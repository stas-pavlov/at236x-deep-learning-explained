Typically, one would start with random initialization of the model parameters.

However, the updates generated using a single observation sample at a time can vary wildly between iterations. An intermediate ground is to load a small set of observations and use an average of the `loss` or error from that set to update the model parameters. This subset is called a *minibatch*.\n",

We repeat the process of model parameters update using different combination of training samples and over a period of time minimize the `loss` (and the error).

Additionally we will make multiple passes through the data specified by the variable `num_sweeps_to_train_with`. With these parameters we can proceed with training our simple multi-layer perceptron network."
